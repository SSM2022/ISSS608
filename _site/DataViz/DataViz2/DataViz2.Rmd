# 1. The Task

The task is to criticize the original data visualization in below Figure 1., suggest the alternative presentation, design the the proposed data visualization using Tableau, describe the step-by-step preparation and interpret the observations revealed by the data visualization prepared. 

![Figure 1. Original Data Visualisation](data/Original_chart.PNG)

The data source of above visualization is as below:
+ "origin_destination_bus_SZ_202201.csv", this data set was downloaded from LTA Datamall and URA region, planning area and planning subzone information were added by using GIS Overlay operation.
+ "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL", this data provides URA Master Plan 2014 Planning Subzone boundary map in ESRI shape file format. It was downloaded from data.gov.sg.

# 2. Critique of Visualisation

## 2.1 Clarity

***(a) No dashboard title:*** The original design doesn't have dashboard title. It is unclear which country the data is about, which period and what type of trips.

***(b) Unclear Sub-chart title:***  "Adjacency Matrix" may be difficult for people who have no mathematics background to understand.

***(c) Confusing Tooltips***  "Adjacency Matrix" tooltips show "% of Total Total Trips along Table (Across)". This is confusing for people to understand what the data represents.

***(d) Missing annotation*** There is no annotation about how to use this interactive dashboard.

***(e) Abbreviation*** In the filters on the right of the dashboard, "Sz" is used to represent "Subzone", which is not easy to understand.

## 2.2 Aesthetic

***(a) No color differentiation:*** Both "Trips generated from" and "Trips attracted to" use the same blue color. This doesn't provide any support for readers to quickly understand the charts.

***(b) Redundant legend :*** The 0% to 100.0% grey scale for "% of Total Total Trips" is redundant. It doesn't provide any useful information.

***(c) Hidden Header Labels*** "WEEKENDS/HOLIDAYS" Y Axis label is not fully viewable due to lack of space.

***(d) Too many graphs:*** There are too many graphs displayed at the same time, regarding trips generated from origins, into destinations, over weekday, over weekend, weekday matrix and weekend matrix. Readers need to compare and analyze multiple graphs to draw conclusions.

## 2.3 Interative Design

***(a) No link between origins and destinations:*** This dashboard is supposed to review the inter and intra-subzone flows. However, the original design doesn't convey any information on what the destinations are for the selected origin and what origins are for the selected destination.

***(b) No filter on the adjacency matrix :*** There is no filter on the adjacency matrix. All the origins and destinations are squeezed into a single chart. It failed to convey any useful information if not looking at the tooltips.

***(c) Single Value List filter*** There are more than 300 subzones. List filter is not proper here due to the length and difficulty to use. Dropdown filter is more proper.

***(d) No link between bar charts and adjacency matrix:*** When filter either origin or destination bar charts, there is no change to the adjacency matrix.

# 3. Proposed Design

The initial sketch of proposed design is as follow:
![](data/0.PNG)

## 3.1 Clarity

***(a) Dashboard Title:*** The proposed design has a clear dashboard title which shows the location, type of trips and time period of the data.

***(b) Sub-chart title:***  The proposed design uses "Destination%" and Origin%" as titles for the adjacency matrix, which is easier for people to understand.

***(c) Confusing Tooltips:***  The proposed design has edited the default tooltips generated to be more explanatory on the data.

***(d) Missing annotation:*** The proposed design has added annotation to explain how to use the interactive dashboard.

***(e) Abbreviation:*** The proposed design has edited all the abbreviations to show the full names of terms.

## 3.2 Aesthetic

***(a) Color differentiation:*** Two colors are used in the proposed design. Blue is used to represent origin information and orange is used to represent destination information.

***(b) Redundant legend :*** All the reduant filters generated during chart planning stages have been removed and only useful legends remained.

***(c) Hidden Header Labels*** "WEEKENDS/HOLIDAYS" labels are fully visible in the tooltip by adjusting the size of chart.

***(d) Embed bar charts into tooltips:*** To avoid overwhelm readers with too many information in a single screen. Trips by hour bar charts have been embedded into tooltips, which will only be shown once the mouse hangs over it. Weekday and weekend filter is added to have the choice to select which period to look into.

## 3.3 Interative Design

***(a) Origins and destinations map linkage:*** Origin and destination maps are linked. If a single origin is selected on the origin maps, the corresponding destinations will be shown in the destination map.

***(b) Filter on the adjacency matrix :*** Adjacency matrix is also linked to origin or destination filter.If a single origin is selected on the origin maps, the corresponding destinations and percentage share of total trips out of the origin will be shown in the "Destination%" chart. The size of circle reflects the degree of share.

***(c) Single Value List filter:*** Single value list filter has been changed to dropdown filter.

# 6. Major Observations

**(1) Jurong West Central, Bedok North and Tampines East are the top 3 origins in both weekday and weekend. Majority of the bus trips flow from these 3 origins is within the same region.** 
+ The top destinations of Jurong West Central is Jurong West Central, which is 25.86%. Yunnan accounts for another 28.1%.
+ The top destinations of Bedok North is Bedok North, which is 43.78%..
+ The top destinations of Tampines East is Tampines East, which is 44.24%.

**(2) Some bus trips travel far to other subzones.** Even though most bus trips are within nearby regions, some long-distance bus trip travel is also observed. 
+ From Woodlands, there are bus trips to Tampines East and Bedok observed. 
+ From Maritime square, there are bus trips to Woodlands observed.
+ From Chahgi Point, there are bus trips to Chinatown oberved.

**(3) Peak travel hour during weekday is 6-8am and 5-7pm. No similar pattern observed during weekend**
