# 1.0 Introduction

In this task we are going to use heatmap and parallel coordinate plot to segment kid drinks and other by nutrition indicators.

**Heatmaps** visualise data through variations in coloring. Heatmaps are useful for cross-examining multivariate data, through placing variables in the columns and observation (or records) in rows and coloring the cells within the table. Heatmaps are good for showing variance across multiple variables, revealing patterns, displaying whether any variable are similar to others, and for detecting if any correlation exists.

**Parallel coordinates plot** is a data visualization specially designed for visualizing and analysing multivariate, numerical data. It is ideal for comparing multiple variables together and seeing the relationships between them. Parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterize clusters detected during segmentation.

For the purpose of this task, *starbucks_drink.csv* will be used.

# 2.0 Data and Considerations

+ For multivariate visualization, values are usually scaled between 0 to 1 instead of using the absolute values due to the different range of variables. Therefore, we need to remove the unit of each indicator to avoid confusion in the plot.
+ There are different sizes for each type of drinks. Drinks with larger sizes should have higher nutrition values. For an equal comparison, one size will be chosen for this study.
+ In order to create heatmaps, we need to create a matrix with unique row names. As noticed, there are repeated category names and product names. We can group the data by category on average value to study the difference between kid-drinks-and-others category and other categories as a whole. 
+ We can further zoom into more details of kid-drinks-and-others category. As noticed, even though the names of some drinks are the same, differences lie in size, type of milk and type of whipped cream. In order to look into the individual product, we need to create a unique name for each drink by concatenating the general name with different type of milk and type of whipped cream.

# 3.0 Step-by-step Preparations

## 3.1 Installing and loading the required libraries

The code chunk below is to install the packages needed. 

+ **seriation** is to arrange the rows of data optimally after clustering
+ **dendextend** is to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster
+ **heatmaply** is to plot the heatmap
+ **GGally** is to plot the static parallel coordinates plot
+ **parallelPlot** is to plot the interactive parallel coordinates plot
+ **tidyverse** is to clean data


```{r}
packages = c('seriation', 'dendextend', 'heatmaply', 'GGally',  'parallelPlot', 'tidyverse')

for(p in packages){library
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

## 3.2 Data Import

The code chunk below imports *starbucks_drink.csv* into R environment by using [**read_csv()**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of **readr** package.

```{r}
df <- read_csv("data/starbucks_drink.csv") 
```
## 3.3 Data Wrangling

For multivariate visualization, values are usually scaled between 0 to 1 instead of using the absolute values. Therefore, we need to change the variables name and remove the unit to avoid the confusion.

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  rename_with(~str_replace(., "\\([a-z]+\\)", ""))
```

We noticed that the caffeine content column is in character. Below code is to convert the characters to be numbers.

```{r}
df$`Caffeine` = as.numeric(df$`Caffeine`)
```

let's explore the drinks size. 

```{r}
size <- df %>%
  group_by(`Size`) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(`Portion(fl oz)`), count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

size
```  
As seen below, there are 7 named types of size. For large number of data, we will use "Grande" size in this study.

```{r}
df <- df %>%
   filter(Size == 'Grande')
```

Next, we need to group the data by category, since there are many different drinks for each category. Some of the drinks names are the same. **mean** is used to summarize all the data.

```{r}
df1 <- df[, c(1,4:15)] %>%
  group_by(Category) %>%
  summarise_all("mean") %>%
  ungroup()
df1
```

For the heatmaps, we need to change the rows index to category name from row number by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
row.names(df1) <- df1$Category
```

Next, we need to convert the data into matrix format. 

```{r}
df1_matrix <- data.matrix(df1)
```

Now, our 1st cleaned data set *df1_matrix* is ready for plotting. Next, let's filter out the data for kid-drinks-and-others category to look into more details. 

```{r}
kids_drinks <- df %>% 
  filter(Category == 'kids-drinks-and-other')
```

Below code is to create the unique name for each product.

```{r}
kids_drinks <-  kids_drinks %>%
  mutate(Drinks =  paste(`Name`,`Milk`,`Whipped Cream`))
```

Next, let's change the rows index to "Drinks" from row number by using the code chunk below. Then, we change the data into matrix.

```{r}
row.names(kids_drinks) <- kids_drinks$Drinks
Kids_drinks_matrix <- data.matrix(kids_drinks)
```

Now, our *Kids_drinks_matrix* is ready for plotting.

## 3.4 Comparison bwtween kid-drinks-and-others category and other categories

### 3.4.1 Interactive Heatmap - heatmaply()

When analysing multivariate data set, it is very common that the variables in the data sets includes values that reflect different types of measurement. In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.

Three main data transformation methods are supported by **heatmaply()**, namely: scale, normalise and percentilse. For the purpose of this study, percentilse method is chosen given the small observation size and the benefit of being easy to interpret .

In order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the **dend_expend()** and **find_k()** functions of **dendextend** package will be used.

First, the **dend_expend()** will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.

```{r}
df1_d <- dist(percentize(df1_matrix[, -c(1)]), method = "euclidean")
dend_expend(df1_d)[[3]]
```

The output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.

Next, **find_k()** is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.
 
```{r}
df1_clust <- hclust(df1_d, method = "average")
num_k <- find_k(df1_clust)
plot(num_k)
```
Figure above shows that k=2 would be good.

With reference to the statistical analysis results, we prepare the code chunk as shown below.

+ **k_row** is used to produce 2 groups.
+ **colv** is set to NA to remove the dendrogram among the columns
+ the default **seriate** option “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) is used to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns.
+ **margins** is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.
+ **fontsizw_row*8 and **fontsize_col** are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 8.
+ **main** is used to write the main title of the plot.
+ **xlab** and **ylab** are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=8}
heatmaply(percentize(df1_matrix[, -c(1)]),
          dist_method = "euclidean",
          hclust_method = "average",
          k_row = 2,
          Colv=NA,
          seriate ="OLO",
          colors = Blues,
          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),
          fontsize_row = 8,
          fontsize_col = 8,
          xlab="Nutrition Indicators", 
          ylab="Drinks Category", 
          main="Starbucks Drinks Nutrition Indicators by Category \nDataTransformation using Percentising Method")
```

### 3.4.2 Static Parallel Coordinates Plot - ggparcoord()

In this section, we will explore the dataset using **ggparcoord()** of **GGally** package. **ggparcoord()** function doesn't need matrix format of data frame. We can directly use the cleaned *df* dataset.

+ **groupColumn** argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and color the parallel coordinates lines by region name.
+ **scale** argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.
+ **alphaLines** argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line color to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.
boxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.
+ **title** argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.
+ **facet_wrap()** of ggplot2 is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one drink category.
+ **theme()** function in ggplot2 is used to adjust the label with suitable angle and location.

```{r, fig.height= 10, fig.width = 13}
ggparcoord(data = df, 
           columns = c(4:15),
           groupColumn = 1,
           scale = "uniminmax",
           alphaLines = 0.2,
           boxplot = TRUE, 
           title = "Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plot of Starbucks Drinks Nutrition Indicators by Category") +
  facet_wrap(~ Category) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))

```
## 3.5 Drinks segmentation for kid-drinks-and-others category

### 3.5.1 Interactive Heatmap - heatmaply()

Using the same codes and steps as 3.4.1, below visualization of clusterings is created.

First, the **dend_expend()** will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.

```{r}
Kids_d <- dist(percentize(Kids_drinks_matrix[, c(4:15)]), method = "euclidean")
dend_expend(Kids_d)[[3]]
```
The output table shows that “mcquitty” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.

Next, **find_k()** is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.

```{r}
kids_clust <- hclust(Kids_d, method = "mcquitty")
num_k <- find_k(kids_clust)
plot(num_k)
```
Figure above shows that k=10 would be good.To avoid big number of clusters, next best number of clusters is 8.

With reference to the statistical analysis results, we prepare the code chunk as shown below.

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
heatmaply(percentize(Kids_drinks_matrix[, c(4:15)]),
          dist_method = "euclidean",
          hclust_method = "mcquitty",
          k_row = 8,
          Colv=NA,
          seriate ="OLO",
          colors = Blues,
          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),
          fontsize_row = 7,
          fontsize_col = 7,
          xlab="Nutrition Indicators", 
          ylab="Drinks Category", 
          main="Starbucks Kids-Drinks Nutrition Indicators by Product \nDataTransformation using Percentising Method")
```

### 3.5.2 Interactive Parallel Coordinates - parallelPlot()
parallelPlot is an R package specially designed to plot a parallel coordinates plot by using ‘htmlwidgets’ package and d3.js. In order to visualize different clusters, we need to add in the cluster numbers in the dataset.

```{r}
kids_drinks_clust <- kids_drinks[, c(19,4:15)] 

clust_num <- data.frame(cutree(kids_clust, k=8, order_clusters_as_data=FALSE)) %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "Drinks") %>%
  rename(`Cluster No.` = 2)

```

We need then to join above cluster no. data set with *kids_drinks_clust* data set by "Drinks"

```{r}
kids_drinks_clust <- left_join(kids_drinks_clust, clust_num)
```
Next, we can plot the paralle plot.

+ **rotateTitle** argument is used to avoid overlapping axis labels
+ **continousCS** argument can change the default blue colour scheme
+ **histoVisibility** argument is used to plot histogram along the axis of each variables

```{r}
histoVisibility <- rep(TRUE, ncol(kids_drinks_clust))

parallelPlot(kids_drinks_clust,
             continuousCS = "YlOrRd",
             rotateTitle = TRUE,
             histoVisibility = histoVisibility)
```
# 4.0 Results Intepretation
From section 3.4, we can see that kids-drinks-and-other are in the same cluster as cappuccino-blended-beverages and espresso. Kids drink have the highest calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, dietary fiber, and protein among all the drink categories. The only nutrition that kids drinks have less is caffeine, compared to other drinks categories.

From section 3.5, we have below observations:
+ Hot chocolate drinks generally have more caffine.
+ Drinks with milk have more protein
+ Drinks with salted caramel, hot chocolate, milk and whipped cream all together have higher calories. 
+ Healthy choices are juice and creme soy or non-fat milk with no whipped cream and no chocolate and caremel.

# 5.0 Comparison of Heatmaps and Parallel Coordinates Plot
From section 3.4, both heatmap and parallel plot gave the same result that kids drinks, cappuccino-blended-beverages and espresso belong to the same cluster, which have the higher nutrition indicator values, compared to the other cluster. 

The advantage of heatmap over parallel plot is that it is easier to read. Each observation is clearly identifiable with unique name.

The disadvantage of heatmap compared to parallel plot is that the data preparation process is more tedious. Matrix format data is required. Each observation need to have the unique name. 

Interactive parallel plot allows readers to interact with the data, to select and to highlight. However, with large number of observations, the plot becomes messy and difficult to understand. 

Overall, heatmap is the best solution for this analysis.
