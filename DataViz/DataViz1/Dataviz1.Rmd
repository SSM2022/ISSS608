# 1. The Task

The task is to criticize the original data visualization in below Figure 1., suggest the alternative presentation, design the the proposed data visualization using Tableau, describe the step-by-step preparation and interpret the observations revealed by the data visualization prepared. 

![Figure 1. Original Data Visualisation](data/Original_chart.PNG)

The data source of above visualization is Ministry of Manpower, Singapore (MOM). The data are available under the page entitle [Statistical Table: Labour Force](https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/LabourForceTimeSeries.aspx). For the purpose of this Dataviz Makeover exercise, the data on *Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex* was downloaded.

# 2. Critique of Visualisation

## 2.1 Clarity

***(a) Vague graph title:*** The chart title is too brief to convey enough information. Datasheet contains data on Singapore male, female and total labor force participation rate by age group from 1991 to 2021. The title fails to display location information, gender, grouping criteria and time period.

***(b) Incomplete/hidden x-axis labels:*** X axis length is too short to show the full names of all the x-axis labels. For the upper x-axis, "75&O.." and "70&Ov.." are incomplete labels. For the lower x-axis, each section contains the data from 2010 to 2021, but the label only shows year 2015, which is confusing.

***(c) Unclear y-axis title:***  "Lfpr" is not clear to tell the readers what the y-axis represents. There is also no unit displayed.


***(d) Disordered age-group legend*** Age-group order in the legend is disordered. It is confusing and difficult for readers to quickly understand the grouping rules. In addition, there is overlapping of age group for "70 & Over" and "75 & Over".


***(e) Missing annotation and caption*** There is no annotation highlighting the significant findings. There is also no recognition of the data source.


## 2.2 Aesthetic

***(a) Redundant color usage by age group:*** Each column of the chart shows the participation rate by each age group as labelled on the upper x-axis. Legend color by age group looks fancy but doesn't convey any additional information.

***(b) Too few x-axis tick marks:*** For each age group, the visualization contains data from 2010 to 2011. However, there are only 3 tick marks in each age group.

***(c) Improper minor gridline interval*** Vertical minor gridline has uneven interval, which is ugly. There is missing horizontal minor gridline between 2 wide y-axis labels. Overall, both horizontal and vertical minor gridlines fail to provide additional guidance on reading the numbers.

***(d) Repeated x-axis title:*** "Year" label on the x axis are repeated for 14 times in the chart, which is abundant and not beautiful.

***(e) Improper data ink:*** There is data ink on the axes but not in the values of the tick marks.



# 3. Proposed Design

The initial sketch of proposed design is as follow:
![](data/0.PNG){width=100%}

## 3.1 Clarity

***(a) Content:*** The proposed design uses more information, including gender. Chart 1 shows a broad view of total age group labor force participation rate evolution with time by gender. Then, it zooms into the differences between different age groups for females and males.

***(b) Title:*** The proposed design has a proper dashboard title with main information on the location, topic and aspect. Each chart title shows the detailed aspect. The first chart title highlights the total age group and the rate evolution with time. The 2nd chart title highlights the age groups. Subtitles of the 2 charts mentioned the insights from each chart.

***(c) X-axis labels:*** All the x-axis labels are visible fully and reflect the underlying data used. Age groups are in ascending orders. Time frame is from year 2010 to 2021.

***(d) Y-axis labels:*** Y-axis title shows the full name of labor force participation rate and the unit (%).

***(e) Legend:*** Legend is easy to read with only 3 categories to indicate female, male and total female&male. 

***(f) Annotation and caption*** Annotation and caption are added to explain the chart information and show the data source. 

## 3.2 Aesthetic

***(a) X-axis labels:***  The proposed design removed the repeated 'Year' labels.

***(b) Tick marks and reference lines:*** The proposed design clearly shows the axis ticks with 'black' color. Adequate tick marks and references lines are added to provide enough guidance to readers. 

***(c) Gridlines:*** There is no uneven split of charts pane from improper grindline interval.

***(d) Data ink:*** Gender text are colored with the same ink as the line and area in the charts. All the titles and headers are bold for better presentation.

***(e) Font Size:*** Different front sizes for dashboard title, chart main title, subtitle, labels marks, annotation and caption are used for the best fit.

# 6. Major Observations

**(1) Male labor force participation rate is higher than female.** Except for age group of 20 to 24, male labor force participation rate is in general higher than female labor force. For the age group of 20 to 24, female labor force participation rate has been higher than male labor force since 2018. Big increase of female labor force participation rate for the early 20's is observed from year 2020 to 2021. 

**(2) Female labor force participation rate has been increasing faster than male since 2010.** Male labor force participation rate between age 25 to 59 has been relatively stable, compared to the increasing trend of female labor force participation rate. The gap of labor force participation rate between male and female has been shrinking since 2010. 

**(3) The highest male labor force participation rate falls in the 30s groups. The highest female labor force participation rate falls in the late 20s. ** The gap of male and female labor force participation rate widens significantly from late 20s to early 30s. This could be because of women's commitments to family after marriage.  


**(4) The elderly labor force participation rate for both male and female has been increasing.** This observation is for people who are older than 60. This could be because of the better health condition of the elderly and the general trend of increasing retirement age.

**(5) Sharp drop of labor force participation rate for the early 20s happened in 2020.** This could be of the negative impact of the Covid-19 on the employment rate for the graduates.
