# 1. The Task

The task is to critisize the original data visualization in below Figure 1, suggest the alternative presentation, design the the proposed data visualization using Tableau, describe the step-by-step preparation and interpret the observations revealed by the data visualization prepared. 

![Figure 1. Original Data Visualisation](data/Original_chart.PNG)

The data source of above visualization is Ministry of Manpower, Singapore (MOM). The data are available under the page entitle [Statistical Table: Labour Force](https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/LabourForceTimeSeries.aspx). For the purpose of this Dataviz Makeover exercise, the data on *Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex* was downloaded.

# 2. Critique of Visualisation

## 2.1 Clarity

***(a) Vague graph title:*** The chart title is too brief to convey enough information. Datasheet contains data on Singapore male, female and total labor force participation rate by age group from 1991 to 2021. The title fails to display location information, gender, grouping criteria and time period.

***(b) Incomplete/hidden x-axis labels:*** X axis length is too short to show the full names of all the x-axis labels. For the upper x-axis, "75&O.." and "70&Ov.." are incomplete labels. For the lower x-axis, each section contains the data from 2010 to 2021, but the label only shows year 2015, which is confusing.

***(c) Unclear y-axis title:***  "Lfpr" is not clear to tell the readers what the y-axis represents. There is also no unit displayed.


***(d) Disordered age-group legend*** Age-group order in the legend is disordered. It is confusing and difficult for readers to quickly understand the grouping rules. In addition, there is overlapping of age group for "70 & Over" and "75 & Over".


***(e) Missing annotation and caption*** There is no annotation highlighting the significant findings. There is also no recognition of the data source.


## 2.2 Aesthetic

***(a) Redundant color usage by age group:*** Each column of the chart shows the participation rate by each age group as labelled on the upper x-axis. Legend color by age group looks fancy but doesn't convey any additional information.

***(b) Too few x axis tick marks:*** For each age group, the visualization contains data from 2010 to 2011. However, there are only 3 tick marks in each age group.

***(c) Improper minor gridline interval*** Vertical minor gridline has uneven interval, which is ugly. There is missing horizontal minor gridline between 2 wide y-axis labels. Overall, both horizontal and vertical minor gridlines fail to provide additional guidance on reading the numbers.

***(d) Repeated x-axis title:*** "Year" label on the x axis are repeated for 14 times in the chart, which is abundant and not beautiful.

***(e) Improper data ink:*** There is data ink on the axes but not in the values of the tick marks.

# 5. Major Observations

1. **Male labor force participation rate is higher than female.** Except for age group of 20 to 24, male labor force participation rate is in general higher than female labor force. For the age group of 20 to 24, female labor force participation rate has been higher than male labor force since 2018. Big increase of female labor force participation rate for the early 20's is observed from year 2020 to 2021. 

2. **Female labor force participation rate has been increasing faster than male since 2010.** Male labor force participation rate between age 25 to 59 has been relatively stable, compared to the increasing trend of female labor force participation rate. The gap of labor force participation rate between male and female has been shrinking since 2010. 

3. **The elderly labor force participation rate for both male and female has been increasing.** This observation is for people who are older than 60. 

4. **The highest male labor force participation rate falls in the 30s groups. The highest female labor force participation rate falls in the late 20s. ** This could be because of women's commitments to family after marriage.  

5. **Sharp drop of labor force participation rate for the early 20s happened in 2020.** This could be of the negative impact of the Covid-19 on the employment rate for the graduates.
